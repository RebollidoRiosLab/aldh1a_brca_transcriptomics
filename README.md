BRCA Transcriptomics

This repository contains scripts and resources for the analysis of publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data from breast cancer cell lines and patient tumors. The analyses focus on investigating molecular subtypes and the expression patterns of key genes, including the ALDH1A subfamily: ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3 genes.

Data Sources

1. Breast Cancer Cell Lines (Bulk RNA-Seq)
	•	Publicly available data retrieved from the CCLE 2019 dataset via the DepMap portal.
	•	Includes raw read counts for 50 human breast cancer cell lines.
	•	Molecular subtypes classified into basal A, basal B, HER2-enriched, and luminal.

2. Breast Tumor Patient Samples (Bulk RNA-Seq)
	•	Publicly available mRNA gene expression data retrieved from cBioPortal:
	•	Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Cell 2015)
	•	Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)
