# Single-cell Breast Cancer Patient Data

This folder is reserved for the raw count matrices of the **Breast Cancer Single-cell Atlas**.

The raw matrix (`matrix.mtx.gz`, ~50 MB) and is **too large for GitHub** and therefore not included here.

It can be downloaded directly from the Broad Instituteâ€™s Single Cell Portal:

- **Dataset:** [A single-cell and spatially resolved atlas of human breast cancers (SCP1039)](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1039)

## Usage
After download, place the files in this folder with the following structure: data/raw/sc_patients/matrix.mtx.gz
